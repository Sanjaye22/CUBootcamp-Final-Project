## Sentiment Analysis of Drug Reviews 

Our Methods

Our mission was to analyze a publicly available Kaggle dataset “UCI ML Drug Review Dataset”. The dataset consists of a testing and a training file that add up to 160,000 rows and 7 columns. The drug review data contains several different brands of drugs used to treat many disorders. For our project we will use sentiment analysis to attempt to predict the rating an individual will give a drug based on their reviews. We will create an algorithm that converts qualitative consumer ratings into a quantitative metric that can be used to provide feedback to pharmaceutical companies.  

The following data source used:

Why?
Today, consumers have come to expect easily accessible information through experiences of others like them via  ratings and reviews. Our latest research found that 85% of shoppers seek out negative reviews, up from 82% in 2014 (PowerReviews).
